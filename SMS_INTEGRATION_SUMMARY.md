# SMS Integration with Prelude.so - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented a complete SMS integration using Prelude.so that tracks SMS usage against your existing subscription quota system. Here's what has been implemented:

## ✅ Components Implemented

### 1. **Prelude SMS Provider** (`app/notifications/providers/prelude.py`)

- Complete Prelude API integration for SMS transactional messages
- Phone number formatting and validation for international numbers
- Proper error handling and status tracking
- Uses Prelude's `/v2/transactional` endpoint for queue notifications (not verification API)
- Optimized for transactional messages like queue updates and notifications

### 2. **SMS Templates** (`app/notifications/templates.py`)

- **Queue subscription**: Welcome SMS with position and wait time
- **Next in line**: Urgent notification when it's customer's turn
- **Almost your turn**: Warning SMS when close to being called
- **Custom message**: Flexible template for custom notifications

### 3. **Enhanced Notification Service** (`app/notifications/service.py`)

- **Dual notification support** (Email + SMS)
- **SMS methods** for all queue notification types:
  - `send_queue_subscription_sms()`
  - `send_next_in_line_sms()`
  - `send_almost_your_turn_sms()`
  - `send_custom_sms()`
- **Graceful fallbacks** when SMS provider is unavailable

### 4. **SMS Quota Management Service** (`app/notifications/sms_service.py`)

- **Centralized SMS quota management**
- **Organization-level quota tracking**
- **Automated credit deduction** after successful SMS delivery
- **Detailed quota status reporting**
- **Pre-send quota validation**

### 5. **Updated Queue System**

- **Automatic SMS notifications** when customers are called via `call_next_customer()`
- **Welcome SMS** when joining a queue (if phone number provided)
- **Quota-aware sending** - only sends if credits available
- **Dual notification logging** (Email ✓/✗, SMS ✓/✗)

### 6. **Configuration Updates** (`app/config.py`)

- Added `PRELUDE_API_TOKEN` environment variable
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing Twilio settings

### 7. **Queue Repository Updates** (`app/queue/repository.py`)

- **Integrated SMS quota tracking** into `call_next_customer()`
- **Organization ID resolution** for quota management
- **Subscription service integration** for credit tracking
- **Comprehensive error handling** and logging

### 8. **SMS Quota Status Endpoint** (`app/queue/routers.py`)

- New endpoint: `GET /{queue_id}/sms-quota`
- Returns current SMS quota status for organization
- Includes total, used, remaining credits and plan type

## 🔧 How It Works

### When a customer joins a queue:

1. ✅ System checks if phone number provided
2. ✅ Validates SMS quota for organization
3. ✅ Sends welcome SMS if credits available
4. ✅ Deducts 1 credit from organization's quota
5. ✅ Updates usage tracking in database

### When calling the next customer:

1. ✅ System checks SMS quota for organization
2. ✅ Sends "It's your turn!" SMS if credits available
3. ✅ Deducts 1 credit from organization's quota
4. ✅ Falls back to email if SMS quota exceeded
5. ✅ Logs notification status (Email ✓/✗, SMS ✓/✗)

### Quota tracking:

- ✅ Real-time tracking in `subscriptions.sms_credits_used`
- ✅ Monthly usage statistics in `usage_tracking.sms_sent`
- ✅ Plan-based limits enforced (Free: 0, Pro: 100, Business: 500)

## 📊 Plan Limits

| Plan     | SMS Credits | Queue Limit |
| -------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| FREE     | 0           | 1           |
| PRO      | 100         | 5           |
| BUSINESS | 500         | 999         |

## 🔧 Configuration

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
PRELUDE_API_TOKEN=your_prelude_api_token_here
```

## 📱 SMS Message Examples

**Queue Subscription:**

> Hi John! You've joined the queue at Coffee Shop. Position: #3. Estimated wait: 10 minutes. We'll notify you when it's your turn!

**Next In Line:**

> 🔔 IT'S YOUR TURN, John! Please proceed to Counter 1 at Coffee Shop. Don't keep them waiting!

**Almost Your Turn:**

> ⏰ Almost your turn, John! Position #2 at Coffee Shop. Est. wait: 5 minutes. Please get ready!

## 🔒 Quota Protection

- ✅ **Pre-send validation**: Checks quota before attempting to send SMS
- ✅ **Automatic fallback**: Falls back to email if SMS quota exceeded
- ✅ **Credit tracking**: Deducts credits only on successful delivery
- ✅ **Plan enforcement**: Respects subscription plan limits
- ✅ **Usage monitoring**: Tracks monthly SMS usage per organization

## 🎯 API Endpoints

### SMS Quota Status

```
GET /api/queues/{queue_id}/sms-quota
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "has_subscription": true,
  "plan_type": "PRO",
  "total_credits": 100,
  "used_credits": 25,
  "remaining_credits": 75,
  "can_send_sms": true
}
```

## 🚀 Usage in Code

```python
# Check SMS quota
quota_status = queue_service.get_sms_quota_status(organization_id)

# Send custom SMS with quota tracking
sms_service = SMSService(db)
success, message = await sms_service.send_custom_sms(
    organization_id,
    "+1234567890",
    "Your order is ready for pickup!"
)
```

## ✅ Integration Complete

The SMS system is now fully integrated with your existing:

- ✅ Subscription management system
- ✅ Quota tracking and billing
- ✅ Queue notification workflow
- ✅ Organization access controls
- ✅ Email notification fallbacks

Every SMS sent will be properly tracked against the organization's subscription plan, ensuring accurate quota management and billing compliance.
